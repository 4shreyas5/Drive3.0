# Drive 3.0 - Web 3.0 File Sharing DApp on Polygon's ZK-EVM


*Drive 3.0* is a Web 3.0-based file sharing DApp on Polygon's ZK-EVM that allows users to securely upload and share files using IPFS Pinata.

## Problem Statement

The traditional file-sharing and storage solutions lack security, and user privacy.Users need a decentralized, Web 3.0-based platform that ensures data security, enables real-time collaboration, and protects user privacy while offering an easy-to-use interface. Drive 3.0 aims to provide this solution.

## Solution
Drive 3.0 is a Web 3.0-based, decentralized file-sharing platform built on Polygon's ZK-EVM. It offers robust data security, real-time collaboration, and user privacy. Users can securely upload, share, and collaborate on files with user-managed access controls, all within an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

# Reflection

*Context*: This project is part of a HackCBS Hackathon, showcasing our ability to leverage Web 3.0 technologies and build a decentralized file-sharing application.

*Goals*: We set out to create a secure and user-friendly DApp for file sharing using Polygon's ZK-EVM, IPFS Pinata, and React.js.

*Challenges*: The project presented challenges in integrating Ethereum wallet authentication, real-time collaboration features, and ensuring data privacy and security.

## Tech Stack

*Frontend*:
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS 
- CSS

*Backend*:
- Ether.js (for connection smart contract with frontend)
- Polygon ZK-EVM (for smart contract deployment)
- IPFS Pinata (for decentralized file storage)
- Solidity (for Smart Contract Creation)
- Hardhat (for deploying smart contract in polygon zkEVM)

## How It Works

1. *User Registration*:
   Users create accounts by connecting their Ethereum wallet to the application.

2. *File Upload*:
   Users can upload files to Drive 3.0, which are securely stored on IPFS Pinata.

3. *Permission Management*:
   Users have control over access permissions, sharing files with specific Ethereum addresses and defining access levels.

4. *Real-time Collaboration*:
   Collaborators receive instant notifications when files are accessed, modified, or shared.

## Configuration

To get started with Drive 3.0, configure the following:

- *Ethereum Wallet Integration*: Connect your Ethereum wallet during the registration process.

## Conclusion

*Drive 3.0* is more than just a project; it's a vision for the future of decentralized and secure file sharing. By leveraging Web 3.0 technologies, including Polygon's ZK-EVM, IPFS Pinata, and React.js, we've set out to create a robust and user-friendly platform.

Our choice of technologies, such as React.js, Polygon ZK-EVM, and IPFS Pinata, was driven by a commitment to deliver a high-quality user experience. React's component-based architecture has allowed us to create a responsive and feature-rich frontend, while the backend, powered by Node.js, Polygon ZK-EVM, and IPFS Pinata, ensures the security and decentralization of file storage.


Thank you for exploring Drive 3.0, and we look forward to the road ahead.
